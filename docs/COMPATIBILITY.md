# Compatibility Policy and Matrix

## Independent compatibility axes

“Compatible” is not one claim. The harness records these independently:

- harness API/CLI and record contract;
- `sts2-protocol` release, schema/profile, and conformance contract;
- trajectory, artifact, scoring, and training/dataset schema versions;
- provider profile and model execution contract;
- MCP server revision and gateway API/control-plane contract;
- game-mod/host versions observed through those boundaries;
- operating system, architecture, Rust/runtime/toolchain; and
- persisted configuration, artifact package, and migration format.

The harness does not inherit source or behavioral compatibility from a reference implementation.

## Current evidence baseline

This target contains a non-empty preparation package and one bounded authorized live-host integration trace.
No provider, model, replay service, score, dataset, or released package has been executed or
supported by the target. Compatibility claims remain limited to the exact runtime row recorded below.

| Subject | Current state | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Harness foundation | Pure ports, coordinator seams, and deterministic fakes | Source-derived; offline tests pass |
| MCP/gateway integration | Real component trace against synthetic downstream and exact host | Confirmed for the bounded runtime-v1 path; broader host compatibility unverified |
| Provider/model execution | Not executed | Unverified; no credentials or provider calls |
| Game state/action behavior | Not reachable by design | Unsupported in this repository boundary |
| Replay/artifact lineage | Offline record/replay and metadata seams | Source-derived; deterministic fakes only |
| Scoring | No scoring policy implementation | Proposed contract only |

## Compatibility classifications

Use `contract-compatible`, `additive-compatible`, `deprecated-compatible`, `safety-correction`, or
`breaking`. Every change identifies affected record fields, identifiers, versions, mappings, fixtures,
consumers, migration, and unverified evidence. Do not call a successful parse, acknowledgement,
action acceptance, or recorded trajectory runtime-compatible.

## Version and lineage rules

Keep harness, trajectory/schema, scoring, training/dataset, provider profile, MCP, gateway, game-mod,
protocol, host, and runtime versions independent. A run or artifact manifest binds each input that can affect its
observations, actions, model output, score, replay result, dataset bytes, or package bytes. Digests
bind exact inputs and outputs; wall-clock timestamps do not establish event order.

## Promotion evidence

Future support advances through deterministic offline tests, fake boundary/component tests, real
MCP/gateway integration, approved provider tests, disposable host smoke, focused runtime, and full
conformance. Each level requires exact versions, platform, configuration, artifact hashes, and date.
Missing credentials, services, game files, or disposable data remain visible as `unverified`.

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes require an ADR, migration path, release note, updated fixtures/conformance, and
coordinated consumer review. Additive fields must define old-reader behavior. Unknown fields/enums,
null versus missing, ordering, numeric bounds, identifier namespaces, stale state, and partial effects
must be tested before an additive label is used.

## Runtime coordinator row

| Coordinator | Downstream lane | Current evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sts2-harness-runtime` | `runtime-v1-mcp` -> attached gateway -> STS2 v0.107.1 host | Authorized disposable-host trace | Bounded client-to-host probe confirmed; gameplay mutation and broader compatibility unverified; [evidence](evidence/runtime-v1-host-integration-20260902.md) |

The coordinator does not inherit compatibility from a successful trajectory. Promotion requires an
exact mod/host version, artifact digest, disposable profile, request sequence, fresh observation,
effect witness, and cleanup record.

## Runtime safety correction

The existing Runtime-v1 executable accepts only numeric loopback gateway socket addresses, not DNS
names or remote plaintext bearer endpoints. It bounds complete HTTP/MCP exchanges to five seconds,
validates outer RPC correlation and the existing projected tool contract, and minimizes child
environment/error output. MCP retains full downstream envelope/fence validation authority.
Frozen Runtime-v2 decoder fields remain required even when their permitted value is null.
This tightens existing safety contracts without changing schema/artifact identities or introducing
the unmerged Runtime-v2 coordinator, legacy gameplay, or Exo Runtime-v3 proposals.
effect witness, and cleanup record.
