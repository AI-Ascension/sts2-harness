# Compatibility Policy and Matrix

## Independent compatibility axes

“Compatible” is not one claim. The harness records these independently:

- harness API/CLI and record contract;
- `sts2-protocol` release, schema/profile, and conformance contract;
- trajectory, artifact, scoring, and training/dataset schema versions;
- provider profile and model execution contract;
- MCP server revision and gateway API/control-plane contract;
- game-mod/host versions observed through those boundaries;
- operating system, architecture, Rust/runtime/toolchain; and
- persisted configuration, artifact package, and migration format.

The harness does not inherit source or behavioral compatibility from a reference implementation.

## Current evidence baseline

This target contains a non-empty preparation package but no released artifact or live integration.
No provider, MCP server, gateway, game, model, replay service, score, dataset, or package runtime has
been executed by the target. Therefore all product/runtime combinations are `unverified`, not
supported.

| Subject | Current state | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Harness foundation | Pure ports, coordinator seams, and deterministic fakes | Source-derived; offline tests pass |
| MCP/gateway integration | Not executed | Unverified; use bounded fakes first |
| Provider/model execution | Not executed | Unverified; no credentials or provider calls |
| Game state/action behavior | Not reachable by design | Unsupported in this repository boundary |
| Replay/artifact lineage | Offline record/replay and metadata seams | Source-derived; deterministic fakes only |
| Scoring | No scoring policy implementation | Proposed contract only |

## Compatibility classifications

Use `contract-compatible`, `additive-compatible`, `deprecated-compatible`, `safety-correction`, or
`breaking`. Every change identifies affected record fields, identifiers, versions, mappings, fixtures,
consumers, migration, and unverified evidence. Do not call a successful parse, acknowledgement,
action acceptance, or recorded trajectory runtime-compatible.

## Version and lineage rules

Keep harness, trajectory/schema, scoring, training/dataset, provider profile, MCP, gateway, game-mod,
protocol, host, and runtime versions independent. A run or artifact manifest binds each input that can affect its
observations, actions, model output, score, replay result, dataset bytes, or package bytes. Digests
bind exact inputs and outputs; wall-clock timestamps do not establish event order.

## Promotion evidence

Future support advances through deterministic offline tests, fake boundary/component tests, real
MCP/gateway integration, approved provider tests, disposable host smoke, focused runtime, and full
conformance. Each level requires exact versions, platform, configuration, artifact hashes, and date.
Missing credentials, services, game files, or disposable data remain visible as `unverified`.

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes require an ADR, migration path, release note, updated fixtures/conformance, and
coordinated consumer review. Additive fields must define old-reader behavior. Unknown fields/enums,
null versus missing, ordering, numeric bounds, identifier namespaces, stale state, and partial effects
must be tested before an additive label is used.
